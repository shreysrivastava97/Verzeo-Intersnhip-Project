# Verzeo-Intersnhip-Project
This is my final major project for my internship in Data Science at Verzeo
In this project I was given a datset of old cars with the following features:

    Name: The brand and model of the car.
    Location: The location in which the car is being sold or is available for purchase.
    Year: The year or edition of the model.
    Kilometers_Driven: The total kilometres driven in the car by the previous owner(s) in KM.
    Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car.
    Transmission: The type of transmission used by the car.
    Owner_Type: Whether the ownership is Firsthand, Second hand or other.
    Mileage: The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg
    Engine: The displacement volume of the engine in cc.
    Power: The maximum power of the engine in bhp.
    Seats: The number of seats in the car.
    Price: The price of the used car in INR Lakhs.
    
Along with this we were a given a dataset with the same columns but the prices had to be predicted.
Hence, the aim of the project was to predict the prices of the cars in the second data set based on the first data set.
